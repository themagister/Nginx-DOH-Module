Simple Nginx module for serving DNS-over-HTTPS (DOH) requests.

CAVEAT EMPTOR: This module is experimental, even though I have been using it successfully with both Firefox and Curl, there may be undiscovered bugs. Zone transfer is currently not officially supported.

Tested with Nginx versions:
1.18.0 (stable)
1.19.1 (mainline).

Instructions for building installing and using Nginx modules can be found at the links below.

dynamic: https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/extending/converting/#compiling-dynamic

static: https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/extending/compiling/

I have included a config file for both building as both a dynamic and static module.

This module is only allowed to be used in an http location block.

MODULE DIRECTIVES

doh: (takes no arguments) enable DOH at this location block, default upstream DNS server address is 127.0.0.1, default port is 53, and default timeout is 5 seconds.

doh_address: (takes 1 argument) sets the address of the upstream DNS server, can be either IPv4 or IPv6.

doh_port: (takes 1 argument) sets the port to contact the upstream DNS server on (appies to both TCP and UDP connections).

doh_timeout: (takes 1 argument) sets the timeout in seconds.

EXAMPLES

simplest use case with upstream DNS server listening on 127.0.0.1 on port 53:

```
location /dns-query { 
	doh;
}
```

set an upstream address of 127.0.2.1, a port of 5353, and a timeout of 2 seconds:

```
location /dns-query { 
	doh;
	doh_address 127.0.2.1;
	doh_port 5353;
	doh_timeout 2;
}
```
